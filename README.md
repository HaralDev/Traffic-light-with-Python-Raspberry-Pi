# Traffic light with Python and wiringPi on a Raspberry Pi
Based on Tux Crossing by Gordon Henderson (https://projects.drogon.net/raspberry-pi/gpio-examples/tux-crossing/). I highly suggest reading Gordon's article if you're not familiar with Raspberry GPIO and breadboarding,  which pins to use and how to set up the hardware.
- Used Python and the wiringPi module (https://github.com/WiringPi/WiringPi-Python) \
- Hardware used
  - Raspberry Pi 3 B
  - Half sized breadboard
  - 5 LEDs
  - 5 330 ohm resistors
  - 1 button
  - 6 female - male jumper cables
  - 1 male - male jumper cable

# Code
I included two scripts: Blink.py and Traffic light.py. 
  - Traffic light.py is the main script. I used physical numbering instead of the one that Gordon used in the article. I expect answers to most questions can be found in Gordon's article and the wiringPi github/help. Feel free to ask me questions if you have them. 
  - Blink.pyis a script that will make your leds blink.
